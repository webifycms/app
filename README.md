WebifyCMS is an application framework that enables users to craft stunning web applications. The framework simplifies the creation process with built-in content management features.

* WebifyCMS is designed with **Clean Architecture** and **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** to separate and protect the business logic. It helps to maintain the entire codebase easily and makes it adaptable to technological changes.
* Each bound context has been divided into an extension for easy development, and the base extension contains reusable components.
* Develop with [Yii](https://www.yiiframework.com/) framework to handle the infrastructure without reinventing the wheel.
* Targeting the end-user for easy customization, administrating, designing, and developing new features.
* Fully customizable user interfaces, including the admin panel and theme support.
